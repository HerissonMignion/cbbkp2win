## Goal

A command to save multiple lists of files and directories mapped with
a destination where to copy them.

## Motive

Windows has too many bugs.  As a Linux user, I am forced to work with
it, therefore I use emacs inside wsl2, but i prepare for the
eventuality where windows just nukes my wsl install for no reason, and
where I would lose all my notes and automation scripts.  My solution
for the time being will be to keep backups outside wsl, in /mnt/c/,
but I want to have easy control over what gets copied and when do I
launch begin a copy.
